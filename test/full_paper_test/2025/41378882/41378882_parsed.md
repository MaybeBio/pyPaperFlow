# Impact of intrinsically disordered regions and functional disorder hotspots in the human kinome


## Abstract
  A ubiquitous and reversible phosphorylation is important for molecular signaling cascades, regulated by the transient interaction of protein kinases. The coupled folding and phosphorylation determining substrate specificity re-calibrates the interactive environment of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). There are over 50 computational methods for predicting IDRs in the proteome, yet achieving an accurate depiction remains an ongoing challenge. In this study, we present a standardized and kinase-centric approach for IDR prediction within the human kinome, employing a long short-term memory deep learning framework that achieves a high predictive performance (AUC = 0.97). The web server is now publicly accessible at: https://ciods.in/kindisorder. Our workflow begins with proteome-wide IDR prediction and proceeds with the categorization of short and long IDR segments, followed by an in-depth analysis of their distribution relative to the kinase domain regulatory core. We evaluated the conservation of these IDRs across all 137 human kinase families, computing a trend-setting conservation index to identify both conserved and variable disorder patterns. Through this framework, we uncovered 1039 functional disorder region hotspots that correlate with dynamic conformational shifts, phosphorylation sites, functional motif enrichment, and mutation impact embedded within IDRs. To further validate their regulatory significance, we conducted biophysical profiling of conserved and variable IDRs. Finally, we developed a structural integrity framework to link these IDRs to their influence on intrinsic signaling cascades and substrate specificity. This study offers a comprehensive functional characterization of IDRs in the human kinome, providing a valuable resource for exploring kinase regulation and opportunities in drug repurposing.


## Introduction
  Protein phosphorylation is a key determinant of cellular signaling and function, with several therapeutic strategies primarily focusing on phospho-signaling cascades [1–4]. Despite the extensive catalog of over 500 known kinases and their phosphorylation attributes, one-third of kinases remain uncharacterized, highlighting the understudied nature of these kinases [5, 6]. The current structural ensemble represents only half of the known kinases, primarily capturing their domains [7]. The predominance of unstable conformations over stable states highlights the dynamic necessity of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which play a crucial role in kinase-substrate interactions [8–10], kinase heterodimer assembly [11], flexible transition between active and inactive states [12, 13], and phosphorylation events [14]. The activation loop in the protein kinase frame exhibits intrinsic flexibility, making it partially disordered.

  Studies estimate that the human proteome contains approximately 132000 putative binding motifs within the IDRs [15, 16]. The short linear motifs (SLiMs) enable IDRs to adopt diverse conformations that complement binding targets. The SLiMs within IDRs are more conserved than those in structured regions [17]. For instance, the intrinsically disordered kinase (IDK) insertion domain in RTK KIT is critical for recruiting downstream signaling proteins, highlighting the functional significance of IDRs [18]. This structural flexibility is particularly vital for signaling proteins, where IDRs flank kinase domains and integrate their activity into complex regulatory networks [19].

  In addition to that, missense mutations affecting IDRs raise a question about their structural integrity, with disease-associated mutations disproportionately enriched in these regions [20, 21]. Specific substitutions, such as R → W, R → C, and E → K, often drive structural transitions that disrupt IDR functionality, underscoring the need for comprehensive studies on IDR mutations in kinase signaling pathways. IDR dysfunction has been implicated in cancer [22] and cardiovascular diseases [23].

  In the ERK-RSK-PDK complex, IDRs facilitate communication between distinct kinase cores, thereby ensuring precise signaling specificity [24]. Similarly, Src family tyrosine kinases contain an N-terminal unique domain, i.e. intrinsically disordered and subject to modulation by lipidation, phosphorylation, and alternative splicing [25]. In the AGC-family kinases (e.g. PKA, RSK), the long C-terminal tail is largely disordered and carries multiple SLiMs, specifically the hydrophobic motif, that dock onto the kinase core and stabilize the active conformation [24, 26].

  Several computational tools have been developed to predict disorder from sequence features, often validated using experimental datasets. Early predictors like DISPHOS [27], IUPred [28], PONDR-FIT [29], RONN [30], DISpro [31], DISOPRED [32], and DisEMBL [33] laid the foundation for disorder prediction based on physicochemical properties and statistical patterns. More recent advancements include PredIDR2 [34], flDPnn [35], and DeepCNF-D [36], which leverage deep learning frameworks to improve predictive performance. Additionally, the emergence of protein language models, such as ESM [37] and ProteinBERT [38], has revolutionized the field by capturing contextual residue-level information from massive protein sequence corpora. Community benchmarks (CAID experiment) show that top-performing predictors now rely on deep learning and outshine older biophysical methods, but even these have variable accuracy and run times [39]. Existing tools are primarily designed to predict intrinsic disorder across the entire human proteome, which can introduce considerable noise in both data generation and biological interpretation. To accurately identify relevant human kinome regulatory IDRs, it is essential to incorporate context-specific predictive strategies. Within the human kinome, inconsistent disorder predictions across existing tools may obscure the identification of functionally relevant regulatory IDRs, due to variability in prediction outputs, differences in input parameters (e.g. minimum and maximum region length), underlying algorithmic assumptions, and biases in training data composition. Experimental databases such as DisProt [40] and MobiDB [41] provide valuable annotations of IDRs; however, they still cover only a fraction of the disorder landscape, leaving many regions without experimental validation. Consequently, the aforementioned prediction tools rely heavily on these limited datasets as ground truth references. Despite this, IDRs frequently act as functional hotspots, influencing substrate specificity and kinase activation. Exploring these hotspots can reveal new regulatory motifs and support drug repurposing in kinase signaling pathways.


## Methods

### Data collection and processing
  The human kinome disorder region predictor was developed, trained, and evaluated using the DisProt 9.7 dataset [42]. The dataset comprises 12790 disordered regions across 3114 proteins from various species. After removing duplicates, 5524 entries correspond to Homo sapiens, from which we extracted 1271 disordered regions specific to human proteins. To create a bias, we retrieved 523 human protein kinome disorder region entries from the UniProt database (Supplementary Table 1).


### Feature selection and preprocessing
  From the training data, it is evident that a subset of kinases remains deficient in disorder content annotation. To tackle this, we explored certain physicochemical and thermodynamic parameters and their association with the kinase disorder regions. The selection criteria and features are listed in (Supplementary Table 2 & Supplementary File).


### Model architecture
  The training data is a combined version of Disprot and UniProt. The dataset contains protein sequences along with their binary labels indicating 1 for disorder and 0 for order. Given the varying sequence lengths, we applied zero padding to standardize input dimensions, a crucial step for long short-term memory (LSTM) network processing. Each amino acid in a sequence was transformed into a feature vector comprising hydrophobicity, disorder propensity, and net charge computed using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, accounting for pKa values of ionizable residues at physiological pH (7.4). A binary indicator for residues associated with disorder is also given as a feature.

  We designed a deep bidirectional LSTM network optimized for sequential prediction tasks. LSTMs are well-suited for learning long-range dependencies in protein sequences due to their ability to retain past information through gated memory units. The model comprises an initial bidirectional LSTM layer consisting of 256 units for capturing forward and reverse dependencies within the sequence. The dropout layer has a 40% chance to mitigate overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons. The third layer refines the learned sequence representation using 128 nodes. From that, 64 neurons have fully connected dense layers with a rectified linear unit activation function. The LSTM framework incorporates a similarity-aware representation layer that reduces over-reliance on homologous sequence fragments, thereby mitigating but not fully eliminating the risk of inflated performance due to sequence similarity. The output layer with sigmoid activation function produces per-residue disorder probabilities constrained between 0 and 1. The model is trained using Binary cross-entropy loss, which quantifies the deviation between predicted probabilities (ŷi) and the validation disorder labels (yi).

  After training for 100 epochs with a batch size of 16, we evaluate the model on a held-out test using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) metric is calculated as:

  We compare our model’s ROC curve against multiple other deep learning architectures, such as the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (BiRNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To optimize classification, we introduce a dynamic threshold mechanism. Instead of a fixed 0.5 cutoff for disorder classification, we calibrate an empirical threshold T by maximizing Youden’s J-statistic:

  To ensure robustness, we compare the bit-wise predictions of our model with the flDPnn [35], flDPnn2 [43], ADOPT [44], DisoFLAG [45], and AIUPred [46] tools. The individual sequence accuracy and overall mean accuracy are calculated.


### Functional significance
  To evaluate the role of IDRs in kinase function, we generated high-confidence predictions using our model and mapped them to functional domains, including active sites, binding sites, and conserved motifs. We found that IDRs often overlap with these domains and are linked to dynamic conformational states, highlighting their regulatory significance. Particular attention was given to conserved kinase motifs such as the DFG motif [47], which is critical for ATP binding and activation loop dynamics, and the APE motif [48], which contributes to activation segment stabilization. Additionally, we examined the HRD motif, located within the catalytic loop, and the DLG motif, assessing both its canonical and reverse orientations, which may influence conformational flexibility and regulatory interactions [49]. We dynamically assess the mapping of domains, active sites (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${S}_A)$\end{document}, binding interfaces (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${S}_B)$\end{document}, regions involved in functional motifs (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${S}_R$\end{document}) such as HRD, DFG, APE, EPA, DLG, GLD, GFD, DRH. To evaluate whether a given disorder region overlapped with or was proximal to functional motifs, we defined a buffer window of +10, –10 amino acids around the motif positions. A motif or functional site was considered associated with disorder, the score computed using the following conditions:

  where d represents the distance between the disorder region and the functional motif, and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $\beta$\end{document} is an empirical weight based on motif importance.

  To establish the disorder region overlapping with a kinase domain was considered functionally relevant, so a base score was assigned using a dynamic function:

  where \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $\alpha$\end{document} is an empirically determined weight, \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${L}_{overlap}$\end{document} represents the length of the overlapping region, and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${L}_{domain}$\end{document} is the total domain length.

  To assess how phosphorylation and mutation influence disorder regions, phosphorylation data were extracted from PhosphoSitePlus [50] and mapped to the disorder region. If phosphorylation was detected within a disorder region, it contributed positively based on its regulatory role:

  where \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $\gamma$\end{document} is an empirical weight, and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${f}_{phos}$\end{document}is a function that accounts for phosphorylation events at a site. Similarly, mutation is computed as follows: mutation data extracted from KinaseMD [51].

  \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $\delta$\end{document}  is the empirical weight, and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${f}_{mut}$\end{document} captures the severity of the mutation’s effect on the disorder. The empirical weights α and β were set to reflect the relative structural importance of domain overlap and proximity to conserved kinase motifs (e.g. DFG, HRD), which are known to play critical roles in kinase activation and regulation. The weights γ and δ were assigned to phosphorylation and mutation features, respectively, based on their potential regulatory impact and disruption of disorder regions. These weights were calibrated for balance interpretability and biological significance rather than being strictly optimized.


### Integrated scoring and normalization
  To quantify the functional significance of each disordered region, we assigned a total feature score C using a weighted sum of contributing features:

  The final normalized score was computed using dynamic scaling:

  where \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${C}_{max}$\end{document} and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${C}_{min}$\end{document} represent the maximum and minimum feature scores across all disorder regions. This ensures a robust 0–1 scale for comparative ranking.


### Family-based analysis
  Recognizing the evolutionary diversity of kinase families, we performed a family-specific analysis of IDRs using proximity-based clustering. Disorder regions within 10 residues of each other were grouped into the same cluster, provided they appeared in at least two different kinases. For each valid cluster, we calculated a disorder score based on three metrics, the first being the Sequence Similarity Score (SSS), which quantifies conservation within clustered IDRs.

  where \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${L}_{max}$\end{document} is the length of the longest disorder sequence in the cluster, and \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $I\left({R}_i\right)$\end{document} is an indicator function that counts the number of completely conserved residues across all disorder regions in the cluster.

  The second metric is the positional similarity score (PSS), the overlap between disorder regions within a cluster is assumed to be complete, yielding:

  This simplification ensures that disorder regions in close proximity are treated as functionally relevant. The third metric is the disorder region consistency (DRC), the consistency of disorder region length across kinases in the cluster is determined as:

  where \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{upgreek} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} ${L}_{min}$\end{document} is the shortest disorder region length within the cluster. Considering all three metrics, each cluster is assigned a disorder score as a weighted combination of these metrics:

  The disorder score for each kinase is determined by identifying the highest cluster score in which it appears. This ensures that kinases involved in highly conserved disorder regions obtain a higher disorder score.


### Disorder to order transition
  To evaluate the propensity of IDRs in kinases to undergo disorder-to-order transitions, we developed a biophysically informed scoring framework. For each disordered segment, we computed a set of sequence-derived features using a sliding window approach. These features included secondary structure propensities based on Chou–Fasman parameters, normalized amino acid composition, hydrophobicity profiles using the Kyte–Doolittle scale, and net charge distributions calculated from the presence of charged residues. Additionally, we incorporated side chain volume and flexibility indices from literature, sequence complexity quantified via Shannon entropy, and contact potential estimated using a simplified Miyazawa–Jernigan interaction matrix. These features were integrated into an empirical free energy model, where the weighted sum of these properties yielded a predicted free energy change (ΔG) for the region. This ΔG was then used to estimate the folding rate using an exponential kinetic model that accounts for sequence length and thermal conditions. To make the output biologically interpretable, a logistic transformation was applied to the free energy values, producing a transition probability score between 0 and 1, indicating the likelihood that a disordered region may adopt an ordered structure. Furthermore, to assess the functional impact of mutations within IDRs, we introduced point mutations into the wild-type sequences and recalculated the ΔG and transition probabilities. The difference in energy (ΔΔG) between wild-type and mutant was used to infer whether the mutation stabilizes or destabilizes the region. All equations, parameter details, and model validations are provided in the Supplementary File.


## Results

### High confidence prediction of human kinome intrinsically disordered regions
  Disordered protein regions are amino acid stretches with a high composition of polar or charged amino acids, which lack sufficient hydrophobic amino acids for cooperative folding and definite structure formation. These regions generally contribute to the conformational heterogeneity of proteins by connecting structurally solid regions and carrying linear peptide motifs and PTM sites to enable interactions with different proteins [52]. This is imperative to predict the IDRs in human kinome to streamline the understanding of dynamic, adaptable, and malleable molecular communication [53].

  To study the impact of disordered regions in the human kinome, we compiled a kinase list from KinMap and KinBase. Due to inconsistencies between sources, we normalized the data by mapping entries to official gene symbols. We then filtered kinases based on their domains using UniProt and InterPro, resulting in 500 protein kinases with defined kinase domains and 23 atypical kinases without such domains. Other kinase types (e.g. lipid, nucleic acid, carbohydrate) were excluded, focusing the analysis on these 523 human protein kinases.

  We predicted the disorder status of 523 kinases, ensuring region-wise disorder prediction without any protein length limitations (Supplementary Table 3). The LSTM-based architecture transformed amino acid sequences into a feature matrix, padded to a uniform length and scaled via StandardScaler to fuel a sequential model comprising dual LSTM layers (100 and 50 units) interspersed with dropout (0.2) for regularization, culminating in a dense sigmoid output layer. Trained over 100 epochs with the Adam optimizer. The model achieved high-quality predictions with an validation accuracy of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.97 precision of 0.95, recall of 0.96, and an F1-score of 0.95 (Fig. 1). To evaluate the competitiveness of our proposed architecture against modern deep learning frameworks, we conducted a comparative performance analysis. The LSTM-based model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.97 and a testing accuracy of 0.98, indicating strong predictive capability. Among the compared models, the BiRNN achieved the highest AUC-ROC of 0.99, while the TCN demonstrated the highest accuracy (0.98). Overall, the LSTM framework remains highly competitive, exhibiting an excellent balance between accuracy and generalization across different architectures (Table 1). The ROC curve demonstrates the model’s success in identifying patterns within kinase proteins. For comparative validation, we applied existing disorder prediction tools to the kinase dataset, yielding the following AUC values: flDPnn (0.83), ADOPT (0.93), DisoFLAG (0.88), AIUPred (0.77), and flDPnn2 (0.84) (Fig. 2, Table 2). This validation supports our claim that instead of predicting disorder across the entire human proteome, developing a specialized approach tailored to the human kinome and its characteristic disorder region continuum is crucial, which serves as an adaptive hub in regulatory circuits. After all, it imposes no restrictions on protein length, allowing for comprehensive analysis of both short and full-length protein sequences, an area where many current tools fall short. Second, it provides high-resolution predictions at the single amino acid residue level, enabling fine-grained mapping of intrinsic disorder with unprecedented detail.

  Disordered segments >10–15 amino acids within proteins are generally considered relevant, with short segments often overlooked unless experimentally validated. However, SLiMs (3–10 aa) when conserved across orthologs or protein families, potentially carry heavily post-translationally modified sites, increasing protein complexity. These SLiMs are particularly relevant for human kinases, considering motifs such as DFG (Asp-Phe-Gly) and HRD (His-Arg-Asp) being functionally irreplaceable for kinase activity regardless of their short length. So, to extrapolate regulatory information from these short stretches, we considered predicted disordered regions ≥3 amino acids relevant in the current study.

  Our model has predicted a total of 2863 disorder regions across 518 human kinases, with an average disorder content of 17% per kinase. No disordered regions were identified for kinases GUCY2F, TXK, ADCK5, BCKDK, and PDK2. To estimate the dynamics of disordered regions in human kinases, we calculated the ratio of disordered region composition within each kinase based on the ratio of disordered residues to the total sequence length. The results revealed a wide range of disorder distribution among kinases, ranging from very low to heavily disordered composition. Kinases with heavily disordered composition included CDK11B (52.96%), GTF2F1 (45.84%), CDK11A (44.95%), and PRP4K (44.19%). CDK11B and CDK11A are cyclin-dependent kinases with 795 and 783 aa lengths, respectively. Uniprot has annotated two disordered regions in these kinases, specifically within amino acid ranges 17–412 and 733–795 for CDK11B, and within 18–398 and 721–783 for CDK11A. Our prediction model has mapped seven disordered regions precisely within the ranges 1–16, 20–36, 38–61, 77–274, 293–424, 753–775, and 784–794 for CDK11B and 1–16, 20–36, 38–59, 125–262, 281–405, 741–763, and 772–782 for CDK11A with superior AUC and ROC scores compared to flDPnn2, highlighting the predictive robustness. Only the kinase domain structure of CDK11B [PDB: 7UKZ (428–736 aa)] is currently available crystalized and no crystal structure is available for CDK11A. Considering Deiana et al. (2019) have suggested intrinsically disordered proteins as proteins with more than 30% disordered residues, we categorize these kinases with more than 40% disordered composition to be IDKs with short half-lives [54].

  Low disordered composition kinases included EPHA7, GUCY2C, MUSK, NPR2, and MYO3A, with <0.5% disordered regions. EPHA7 (EPH Receptor A7), MUSK (Muscle Associated Receptor Tyrosine Kinase), and NPR2 (Natriuretic Peptide Receptor 2) are tyrosine kinases, MYO3A (Myosin IIIA) is a Serine/Threonine kinase, and GUCY2C (Guanylate Cyclase 2C) is a dual specificity kinase. These are highly stable and rigid kinases with a larger half-life. They potentially have constitutively active (always on) conformation or are regulated by binding to other proteins or cofactors, as their conformational flexibility could be very limited due to low root mean square deviations reported for alpha helices and beta sheets that make up structured domains [55, 56].


### Distribution of disorder scores across kinase families
  To assess the functional relevance of disordered regions across kinase families, we evaluated the conservation of DRs across kinase families. Three metric parameters were used as features for conservation analysis. Sequence similarity—to capture residue-level alignment, Positional similarity—to assess overlaps in disorder locations, and regional consistency—to reflect the recurrence of disordered segments across the sequences (see Methods). The FASTA sequences of the entire human protein kinome were assembled, and their corresponding family information was fetched from KinHub [57]. Further to better comprehend the conservation of disordered regions across families, we classified disordered regions based on their length into short (1–20 aa) and long (>20 aa) disordered regions as previously described by Oates et al. (2013) [58].

  As overall conservation of proteins across a kinase family varied, with proteins mostly showing a high level of conservation only within the kinase domain. However, disordered region conservation was noted in the internal and N- & C-terminal segments of many kinase families. For instance, considering short disordered regions, AKT kinases exhibit a conserved mean disorder score of 0.50 ± 0.02 (n = 17 regions across three kinases), predominantly located in the N- and C-terminal regions (82% of IDRs), and show minimal intra-family variance (σ2 = 0.001), suggesting consistent structural flexibility conducive to dynamic signaling interactions. SRC kinases present a moderate and uniform disorder score (0.50 ± 0.00, n = 1 region), primarily at the N-terminus. In contrast, CDK family members display a broader disorder range (mean = 0.32 ± 0.07, n = 36 regions across 18 kinases), with substantial diversity across N-terminal and internal IDRs (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, P < .01). Notable outliers, such as CDK9 with a uniquely short IDR (length = 1, Z-score = −2.3), may indicate functional divergence or unique regulatory mechanisms. On the other hand, for long disordered regions, the overall mean disorder score is 0.35 ± 0.22, with families like Aurora (Aur), NAK, DCAMKL, MLCK, and NEK exhibiting the highest average scores (>0.55). In contrast, families such as LISK, JAK, Insulin receptor family, IRAK, and YANK display a complete absence of long disordered segments (mean = 0.0). The data are listed in Supplementary Tables 4 & 5.

  In the comparative context of conservation, short and long stretch IDRs in the human kinome reveal distinct patterns of disorder conservation. Short stretch IDRs display a wide range of mean disorder scores (0.0 to 1.0), indicating variable conservation across kinase families, where higher disorder scores may reflect less conserved, rapidly evolving regions adapted for diverse signaling roles. In contrast, long stretch IDRs exhibit a more constrained range of mean disorder scores (0.0 to 0.55), suggesting greater conservation, likely due to their structural roles within kinase domains that require balanced flexibility for function. The disorder score distribution is displayed in Fig. 3. To analyze the relationship between evolutionary conservation of long and short IDRs, Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was implemented. Low Spearman correlation highlights that conservation mechanisms differ between short and long IDRs, with short stretches showing greater evolutionary divergence and long stretches maintaining higher conservation, possibly to preserve essential kinase functionality across species.


### Analysis of functional hotspot disorder regions
  To identify functionally significant DRs within protein kinases, we sought to define DR functional hotspots in human protein kinases, based on its domain overlap, proximity to functional key motifs, presence of phosphorylation sites and impact of mutations.

  A total of 125 short-stretch disorder regions were identified within kinase domains, each potentially contributing to kinase-specific functions (Supplementary Tables 6 & 7). Using a functional hotspot prediction threshold of 0.12, we categorized these regions based on their disorder intensity and spatial distribution. Among these, 40 were classified as long-stretch disorder regions. Functional hotspots were confidently assigned to 25 of these, spanning across 20 different kinases. Strikingly, a pronounced N-terminal localization bias was observed, with 42.5% of functional hotspots situated within the first 50 amino acid residues. This spatial preference suggests a potential regulatory role for N-terminal intrinsic disorder, possibly mediating dynamic interactions with substrates, cofactors, or regulatory partners. Normalized disorder scores for these hotspots predominantly clustered below 0.2, indicating moderate disorder, although a subset displayed higher disorder intensities, reaching up to 0.32.

  In the kinase divergence, TAF1 exhibited multiple functional hotspots within the domain, suggesting involvement in processes requiring significant conformational flexibility. The N-terminal disorder region of TP53RK demonstrated the highest disorder intensity (0.32) within the domain, marked by the presence of APE and EPA motifs. This region also contained a predominant phosphosite and a novel mutation, underscoring its likely regulatory importance.

  Beyond the kinase domain, we identified 635 short-stretch disorder hotspots and 345 long-stretch disorder hotspots (Supplementary Tables 8 & 9). These exhibited normalized scores above the 0.12 threshold. Kinases, including TTN, OBSCN, WNK1, and ALPK3, harbored multiple high-scoring hotspots, reinforcing the notion that disordered regions outside canonical domains also serve as hubs of regulatory flexibility and functional adaptation. Figure 4 portrays the important functional disorder hotspots in terms of kinase domain.

  In long-stretched disorder scores ranged from 0.04 to 0.38, with most regions exhibiting moderate disorder (mean score: 0.14), suggesting that flexible but not fully unstructured segments dominate kinase regulation beyond the catalytic core. Several kinases, including TTN (five hotspots), WNK1 and CDK12 (4 each), as well as ABL1, TRIO, SPEG, and others with three hotspots each, showed a pronounced enrichment of high-scoring disordered segments. Among all analyzed kinases, ABL1 emerged as a top candidate with a prominent long-stretch disorder hotspot located outside its kinase domain. This region is functionally enriched by the presence of hallmark kinase motifs—HRD, and nearby APE and EPA sequences—typically associated with catalytic regulation and structural stabilization within the kinase domain. Remarkably, this disordered segment also harbors four experimentally validated phosphosites: T532-p, S535-p, S559-p, and S569-p. The co-occurrence of these motifs and phosphosites within a disordered context suggests that this region in ABL1 acts as a unique region.

  Functional disorder hotspot scores for short disordered regions in kinases range from 0.04 to 0.28 (average 0.09). Notably, 106 kinases have only one DR region, often outside the kinase domain, indicating flexible but partly structured roles in regulation. Kinases like TTN, OBSCN, ALPK3, and MAST4 showed high enrichment, with TTN alone having over 100 segments, 6.3% of which are hotspots containing key motifs (GFD, APE) and validated phosphosites, highlighting their role as multifunctional regulatory modules.


### Structural integrity of intrinsically disordered regions in human kinome
  The initial consideration ended up with how these IDRs are localized in kinase, which we have addressed with the hydrophobic-based solvent exposure index; hydrophobic concentrated IDRs are confined to the inside, to attain a stable energy propagation. Some kinases, such as AKT/PKB, are regulated by a disorder-to-order transition of their activation loop upon its phosphorylation [59]. Under this interpretation, we tried to calibrate the wiring and rewiring events to decipher unique transition properties of the IDRs, which further vary with their functional relevance. The N-terminal region of AKT1 (residues 1–6: MSDVAI) is identified as intrinsically disordered, aligning with established regulatory mechanisms in kinases like AKT/PKB, where phosphorylation induces structural transitions. Phosphorylation at Serine-2 (S2) within this disordered segment leads to a ΔΔG of −0.500 kcal/mol, indicating a significant gain in structural stability. Additionally, the predicted transition probability of 77.02% strongly suggests a disorder-to-order transition upon phosphorylation. These findings support the notion that phosphorylation at S2 acts as a molecular switch, promoting structural ordering of the disordered region and potentially enabling AKT1 activation and downstream signaling. When a mutation is introduced, the severity of the kinases may change, further affecting the continuity level. The proposed framework allows users to input a kinase, its disordered region, and a missense mutation, and returns a probability score indicating the likelihood of structural integrity. Looking at this specific case for AKT1, where the wild-type sequence MSDVAI mutates to MSDLAI at position 4 (V to L), the ΔG values tell us the wild-type is −0.274 (kcal/mol, I assume), and the mutant is −0.208, giving a ΔΔG of 0.066 (see Fig. 5). A positive ΔΔG suggests the mutation slightly destabilizes the protein, as it indicates a less favorable folding energy. The small changes in ΔΔG (like 0.5–1 kcal/mol) can hint at stability shifts, and 0.066 is pretty minor, so the effect might be subtle.


## Discussion and conclusions
  This study presents a high-confidence prediction of IDR in the human kinome. Current prediction tools heavily compress the proteome-level insights. They also struggle with accurately identifying short disorder regions, which play crucial roles in molecular recognition [60]. Our model outperforms flDPnn, flDPnn2, ADOPT, DisoFLAG, AIUPred in AUC, and ROC metrics, highlighting its predictive strength. While flDPnn2 surpasses many existing tools, most models struggle with long sequences, introducing noise at the proteome scale. Many cannot handle proteins over 5000 amino acids, limiting their use in large kinases like OBSCN and TTK. In contrast, our approach provides a scalable, accurate solution for disorder prediction across diverse kinases.

  To further probe the functional significance of kinase IDRs, we categorized the IDRs in domain-specific categorization involving a logical analysis bound to short and long stretch IDRs. It is imperative that molecular recognition property identification and interpretation of flexibility segments in understudied kinases. Using a combination of functional motifs, distance metrics, mutation probability, MultiPTM context, and reported phosphosites evaluated how functional DR hotspots alter kinase modularity. This allowed us to explore how sequence variations within IDRs contribute to disease-associated dysfunctions or regulatory modifications.

  Statistical comparisons between short and long disorder scores revealed distinct distribution patterns, suggesting that long disordered stretches are more conserved and potentially more functionally relevant. Detailed mapping across kinase domains further highlighted that long disorder regions often lie outside the canonical kinase domains, frequently overlapping with hotspots of post-translational modifications and functional motifs, thereby implying regulatory roles. Conversely, short disorder regions, although present both within and outside domains, showed less pronounced conservation. Finally, mutation analysis of a representative AKT kinase demonstrated the structural and energetic impact of a point mutation within a disordered region, with a moderate shift in ΔG and significant transition probability, underscoring the potential of disorder-associated residues to influence protein dynamics. Together, these findings underscore the critical regulatory and functional roles of IDRs in kinase biology and provide a valuable framework for further exploration of disorder-mediated signaling and disease-associated mutations. While our free energy-based model effectively explains the impact of many site-specific mutations by integrating sequence, secondary structure, and side chain information, it is not without limitations. In particular, the model may underperform for mutations involving long-range allosteric effects, regions with sparse structural or evolutionary data, or those influenced by post-translational modifications. These cases highlight areas for future refinement and the potential integration of additional contextual or structural dynamics data.
