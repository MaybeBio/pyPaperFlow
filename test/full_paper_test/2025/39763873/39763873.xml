Characterizing IDR interfaces is challenging experimentally and computationally. The state-of-the-art AlphaFold-multimer and AlphaFold3 can be used to predict IDR binding sites, although they are less accurate at their benchmarked confidence cutoffs. Here, we developed Disobind, a deep-learning method that predicts inter-protein contact maps and interface residues for an IDR and its partner, given their sequences. It uses sequence embeddings from the ProtT5 protein language model. Disobind outperforms state-of-the-art interface predictors for IDRs. It also outperforms AlphaFold-multimer and AlphaFold3 at multiple confidence cutoffs. Combining Disobind and AlphaFold-multimer predictions further improves the performance. In contrast to current methods, Disobind considers the context of the binding partner and does not depend on structures and multiple sequence alignments. Its predictions can be used to localize IDRs in large assemblies and characterize IDR-mediated interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP)</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered regions (IDR)</kwd><kwd>protein structure</kwd><kwd>deep learning (DL)</kwd><kwd>protein language model (pLMs)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award01"><funding-source>Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) TIFR</funding-source><award-id>RTI 4006</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award02"><funding-source>Department of Science and Technology (DST) SERB</funding-source><award-id>SPG/2020/000475</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award03"><funding-source>Department of Biotechnology (DBT)</funding-source><award-id>BT/PR40323/BTIS/137/78/2023</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award04"><funding-source>Government of India</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P10">Intrinsically disordered proteins or regions (IDPs or IDRs) lack a well-defined three-dimensional structure in their monomeric state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Oldfield &amp; Dunker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">Wright &amp; Dyson, 1999</xref>). They exist as an ensemble of interconverting conformers in equilibrium and hence are structurally heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Lindorff-Larsen &amp; Kragelund, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Oldfield &amp; Dunker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Uversky, 2013b</xref>). Here, we use the term IDR for both IDPs and IDRs. The heterogeneity of IDRs provides several functional advantages including the ability to overcome steric restrictions, have a large capture radius, undergo functional misfolding, and interact with multiple partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fonin et al., 2018</xref>). They play critical roles in cellular processes including signaling, intracellular transport, protein folding, and condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Fonin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R80">Uversky, 2013b</xref>).</p><p id="P11">IDRs are known to mediate a large number of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R78">Tompa et al., 2014</xref>).

For example, IDRs with short linear motifs (SLiMs) may form multivalent interactions with their partner, exchanging between conformations where one or more motifs bind at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Orand &amp; Jensen, 2025</xref>). This heterogeneity in binding makes their structural characterization in complexes challenging.</p><p id="P12">Here, we develop a deep learning method to determine the binding sites of an IDR and an interacting partner protein given their sequences. Several methods have been developed for predicting interface residues, inter-protein contact maps, and structures of complexes formed by two proteins. Some of them are limited by the requirement of a structure of the input proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Christoffer &amp; Kihara, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">Dai &amp; Bailey-Kellogg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">Gainza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Lin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Pittala &amp; Bailey-Kellogg, 2020</xref>). Sequence-based methods that require a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) are often limited by the low sequence conservation of IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bret et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">B.-G. Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Other sequence-based methods for IDRs use physicochemical features or embeddings from protein language models (pLMs) but do not account for the partner protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Jahn et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Mészáros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R76">Singh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">F. Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). However, the knowledge of the partner protein is crucial in understanding IDR interactions as these are context-dependent. To this end, FINCHES predicts intermolecular interactions for two IDRs based on their chemical specificity, given their sequences. However, it is currently limited to IDRs that remain disordered upon binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Ginell et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p id="P13">State-of-the-art methods like AlphaFold2 (AF2) and AlphaFold3 (AF3) tend to provide low-confidence predictions for IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). Even though the low-confidence regions predicted by AF2 often correspond to the presence of IDRs, the predicted structure cannot be considered a representative IDR structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Alderson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R70">Ruff &amp; Pappu, 2021</xref>). Recent studies showed that AlphaFold-multimer (referred to as AF2 hereon) could predict the structures of complexes where the IDR undergoes a DOR transition, including protein-peptide complexes and domain-motif complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bret et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">B.-G. Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">Omidi et al., 2024</xref>). However, the results may be sensitive to the inputs, such as the sequence fragment size, the fragment delimitation, and the alignment mode for the MSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Bret et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">B.-G. Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In general, predicting the binding interfaces for IDRs at high resolution remains a challenge for current methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R84">Verburgt et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p id="P14">Our method, Disobind, predicts the inter-protein contact maps and interface residues for an IDR and its partner from their sequences. Predicting inter-protein contact maps for IDRs presents several challenges. The structural data for IDRs in complexes is limited, the IDRs may retain their heterogeneity in complexes, and the inter-protein contact maps can be sparse. Here, we leverage the pLM ProtT5 to train our model with limited data, without the need for large, resource-intensive architectures. Predicting coarse-grained inter-protein contact maps and interface residues reduces problems associated with sparsity and heterogeneity. Disobind performs better than state-of-the-art interface predictors for IDRs and better than AF2 and AF3 across multiple confidence cutoffs used in this study. Combining the Disobind and AF2 predictions further improves the performance. We demonstrate the performance of Disobind+AF2 on several IDR complexes, on multiple examples, including several DOR and DDR complexes. Predictions from the method can be used to localize IDRs in integrative structures of large assemblies. They can be used to characterize protein-protein interactions involving IDRs, identify novel motifs, and modulate IDR-mediated interactions.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Disobind dataset creation</title><p id="P15">Given a pair of protein sequences, at least one of which is an IDR, Disobind predicts binary inter-protein contact maps and interface residues for the pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). We compile our dataset by gathering structures of IDR-containing complexes from an array of existing IDR databases and datasets, including DIBS, MFIB, FuzDB, PDBtot, PDBcdr, DisProt, IDEAL, and MobiDB, covering a range of IDR binding modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>) (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S24">Methods</xref>). Missing residues in the structures are excluded from the input sequences, resulting in sequence fragments for each PDB chain. Further, we restrict the maximum length of a sequence fragment to 100 residues for computational reasons.</p><p id="P16">We classify a sequence fragment as an IDR based on annotations supported by experimental evidence and sequence-based homology obtained from DisProt, IDEAL, and MobiDB; an IDR fragment has at least 20% residues annotated as disordered (See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S24">Methods</xref>). Next, we obtain inter-chain binary complexes from each PDB structure, in which at least one of the two fragments is an IDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). We obtain contact maps for all binary complexes. The contact maps are grouped based on the UniProt accessions of the corresponding sequence fragment pair. Next, we merge all contact maps with overlapping sequences in a group using a logical OR operation to obtain a merged contact map, ensuring that the length of each sequence fragment is up to 100 residues. Together, the sequence fragments for the pair and the corresponding merged contact map form a merged binary complex. Disobind is trained on a dataset of merged binary complexes with the sequence fragments as input and the merged contact map as output. The merged contact map encompasses contacts formed across all available structures of the complex, accounting for the multiple conformations of an IDR in a complex. This simplified output representation avoids making any assumptions about binding mode, allowing it to be applicable to DOR and DDR cases. Further, this provides for a less sparse output representation compared to an ensemble of contact maps, while also mitigating the bias caused by having an unequal number of structures for different sequence fragment pairs.</p><p id="P17">We then create an out-of-distribution (OOD) test set comprising merged binary complexes where the input sequence fragments share less than 20% identity with the Disobind dataset and with the AlphaFold2 PDB70 dataset. The remaining complexes are further split into a train, validation, and an in-distribution (ID) test set. The ID and OOD test sets comprise 297 and 52 merged binary complexes respectively. Adding more complexes to the OOD test set may be achieved by increasing the sequence identity cutoff but would also increase similarity to the AF2 training dataset, which we attempted to avoid.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Model architecture</title><p id="P18">Disobind uses a shallow feedforward neural network architecture with the sequence embeddings obtained from a protein language model as input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig 2</xref>). The input embeddings are projected to a lower dimension using a projection block. Next, in the interaction block, the projected embeddings are used to compute the outer product and outer difference, which are subsequently concatenated along the feature dimension. This allows the model to capture complementarity between the input sequences and yields an interaction tensor. This interaction tensor is processed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for contact map prediction. For interface residue prediction, the interaction tensor is first reduced by computing row-wise and column-wise averages and further processed by an MLP. Finally, an output block provides element-wise sigmoid scores, with a score greater than 0.5 representing a contact or interface residue. The outputs are binary contact maps or binary interface residue predictions on the fragments. The model is trained with the singularity-enhanced loss (SE loss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">Si &amp; Yan, 2021</xref>) using the AdamW optimizer with weight decay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>). This loss is a modified form of the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss used for class-imbalanced training. We varied the hyperparameters of the network including the projection dimension, the number of layers in the MLP, and the SE loss parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig S1</xref>).

It performs better than a random baseline (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S24">Methods</xref>) on the OOD test set (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). However, predicting residue-wise inter-protein contact maps is challenging due to their sparsity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S6</xref>). This leads to a class imbalance, biasing the model to predict just the majority class, <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, 0’s or non-contacts. The heterogeneity of IDRs in complexes poses another challenge.

Notably, we coarse-grain over embeddings from pLMs, which provide context-aware, abstract representations of the sequence.

Third, inter-protein contact maps are typically sparse, with only a few residues forming contacts. Although not sufficient, we gather all available structures for IDRs in complexes. With these, we create a dataset of merged binary complexes for training Disobind. Using merged binary complexes helps overcome the issue of sparsity associated with training on an ensemble of contact maps.

For this, we first obtained Uniprot identifiers (IDs) of proteins containing IDRs from DisProt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Aspromonte et al., 2024</xref>), IDEAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Fukuchi et al., 2014</xref>), and MobiDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Piovesan et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). Specifically, from Disprot, we obtained all UniProt IDs corresponding to each DisProt entry. From IDEAL, we obtained UniProt IDs for entries annotated as “verified ProS”. These sequences are experimentally verified to be disordered in isolation and ordered upon binding. From MobiDB, we obtained UniProt IDs for entries annotated “curated-disorder-priority”, “homology-disorder-priority”, “curated-lip-priority”, and “homology-lip-priority”. These correspond to sequences with curated experimental evidence for disorder (“curated-disorder”), their homologs (“homology-disorder”), sequences with experimental evidence for disorder with binding motifs such as SLIMs (“curated-lip”), and their homologs (“homology-lip”), respectively. Homology-based annotations were incorporated due to the lack of sufficient experimentally curated data available for IDRs. Importantly, the annotations were based on the source with the highest confidence (“priority”), and annotations based on indirect sources of evidence or predictions were not considered. Choosing the highest confidence annotation may reduce false positive “disorder” or “lip” annotations that may arise from homology-based evidence.</p><p id="P53">A total of 357734 unique Uniprot IDs across MobiDB, Disprot, and IDEAL were obtained. The PDB REST API was queried to obtain all the PDB entries associated with a given Uniprot ID, resulting in 48534 PDB entries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R69">Rose et al., 2021</xref>). Combining these with the PDB entries obtained in the previous step, we obtained 50294 unique PDB entries. As an aside, we note that MobiDB now provides the PDB IDs for IDR-containing complexes, however, this functionality was not available when this project started.</p></sec><sec id="S29"><title>Defining binary complexes containing IDRs</title><p id="P54">The above PDB entries were downloaded using the Python requests library and mapped to the sequences in UniProt using the SIFTS (Structure Integration with Function, Taxonomy, and Sequence) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R83">Velankar et al., 2013</xref>). Entries with an obsolete PDB ID and those lacking a SIFTS mapping were removed, and deprecated PDB IDs were replaced with superseding PDB IDs. Further, entities corresponding to chimeric proteins or non-protein molecules, those having an obsolete UniProt ID, and those containing more than 10000 residues were removed.</p><p id="P55">Next, for each PDB entry, we obtained sequence fragments by removing missing residues from the sequence of each chain. The length of these fragments was kept to between 20 and 100 residues. Fragments longer than 100 residues were further divided due to constraints on GPU memory, that limited the scalability of the model architecture. We then identified the disordered residues in these fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). This was achieved by cross-referencing the UniProt mapping of the fragment with the disorder annotations from DisProt, IDEAL, and MobiDB as obtained above; a residue was considered disordered if it was annotated as such in any of these three databases. Fragments comprising at least 20% disordered residues were considered as IDR fragments whereas the others were considered as non-IDR fragments. This cutoff balances an over-representation of ordered residues while ensuring enough training data. This is also consistent with proteome-wide analyses which indicate that proteins with IDRs have 13–28% disordered residues. Specifically, annotations based on experiments indicate a 17% disorder fraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Piovesan et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p id="P56">Subsequently, a set of binary complexes was constructed from each PDB entry. Each binary complex consisted of an IDR fragment paired with another IDR or non-IDR fragment. Binary complexes comprising solely of intra-chain fragments or non-IDR fragments were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). This resulted in a total of 2369712 binary complexes.</p></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Creating merged binary complexes</title><p id="P57">We then created contact maps from these binary complexes. A contact map is a binary matrix of zeros (non-contacts) and ones (contacts); two residues are in contact if the distance between their <italic toggle="yes">Cα</italic> atoms is less than 8 Å. We merged the contact maps across different binary complexes of a sequence fragment pair, to create “merged contact maps” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). This allows us to account for contacts from all available complexes. Further, a merged contact map is less sparse and therefore easier to learn compared to an ensemble of contact maps. It also mitigates the bias caused by having different numbers of structures for different sequence fragment pairs.</p><p id="P58">We first grouped the binary complexes across all the PDB entries by the UniProt ID of the constituent proteins in the sequence fragment pair, resulting in 14599 UniProt ID pairs/groups. For computational efficiency, all binary complexes with no contacts were eliminated. The remaining binary complexes in a group were sorted based on the UniProt start residue positions of the protein fragments in the pair and further partitioned into sets. Each set comprised binary complexes containing overlapping sequences (more than one residue overlap) for both fragments such that the sequence length for each fragment, merged across the overlapping sequences, does not exceed the maximum fragment length (100 residues). Contact maps for all binary complexes in a set were aggregated using a logical OR operation to form “merged contact maps”. A sequence fragment pair with the corresponding merged contact map comprises a merged binary complex. We obtained 24442 merged binary complexes. Finally, we filtered merged binary complexes for which the contact density was very high (&gt;5%) or very low (&lt;0.5%), resulting in 6018 merged binary complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S31"><title>Creating the training set and OOD test set</title><p id="P59">We created an out-of-distribution (OOD) test set that is sequence non-redundant with our training dataset and the PDB70 dataset used for training AlphaFold. We first removed merged binary complexes whose sequence fragments were derived from a PDB chain in PDB70. We then obtained a non-redundant set of sequences by clustering our dataset of sequence fragments and the PDB70 cluster representatives using MMSeqs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R77">Steinegger &amp; Söding, 2017</xref>). MMSeqs2 was used at a 20% sequence identity threshold and cluster mode 1. Since the PDB70 dataset is already clustered at 40% sequence similarity, we consider only the representative cluster members for sequence identity comparisons.</p><p id="P60">For the OOD test set, we selected clusters without any chain from PDB70 that are singleton (only one cluster member <italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> self) or doublet (two member sequences, both belonging to the same merged binary complex) clusters. This resulted in 53 merged binary complexes for the OOD test set. We removed an OOD test set entry for which AF2 predictions could not be obtained, resulting in 52 OOD test set complexes. The remaining dataset was split into a training (train), development (dev), and an in-distribution (ID) test set in the ratio 0.9:0.05:0.05, resulting in 5362 train, 298 dev, and 297 ID test set merged complexes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S32"><title>Disobind Model Architecture and Training</title><sec id="S33"><title>Notations</title><p id="P61">Here, we define the notation used in this paper.</p><p id="P62"><italic toggle="yes">R<sup>A×B×C×D</sup></italic>: 4D tensor with the axes <italic toggle="yes">i, j, k, l</italic> corresponding to the four dimensions of size <italic toggle="yes">A, B, C, D</italic> respectively</p><p id="P63"><italic toggle="yes">N</italic>: batch size used for training.</p><p id="P64"><italic toggle="yes">L</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic toggle="yes">L</italic><sub>2</sub>: lengths of protein sequence fragments 1 and 2 indicating the number of residues in each protein.</p><p id="P65"><italic toggle="yes">C</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic toggle="yes">C</italic><sub>3</sub>: the sizes of embedding or feature dimensions.</p><p id="P66"><italic toggle="yes">E</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic toggle="yes">E</italic><sub>2</sub>: embeddings for protein sequence fragments 1 and 2.</p><p id="P67"><italic toggle="yes">O</italic>: interaction tensor obtained post-concatenation.</p><p id="P68"><italic toggle="yes">O<sub>red</sub></italic>: output from the multi-layer perceptron block, reduced from the interaction tensor.</p><p id="P69"><italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic toggle="yes">I</italic><sub>2</sub> interface tensors for proteins 1 and 2.</p><p id="P70"><italic toggle="yes">I</italic>: concatenated interface tensors.</p><p id="P71"><italic toggle="yes">Linear</italic>: applies a linear transformation, <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Linear</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p id="P72"><italic toggle="yes">ELU</italic>: exponential linear unit, <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M2"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">max</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p id="P73"><inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M3"><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Sigmoid</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>.</p><p id="P74"><italic toggle="yes">Dropout</italic>: regularization technique that randomly sets weights to 0.</p><p id="P75"><italic toggle="yes">LNorm</italic>: layer normalization.</p><p id="P76"><italic toggle="yes">Concat</italic>([<italic toggle="yes">A, B</italic>]<sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub>): concatenate tensors <italic toggle="yes">A, B</italic> along the axis <italic toggle="yes">i</italic>.</p><p id="P77"><italic toggle="yes">A<sub>ijkl→ikjl</sub></italic>: permute tensor <italic toggle="yes">A</italic> along the specified axes.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>Inputs and outputs for training</title><p id="P78">We train six separate models, corresponding to six prediction tasks.

AF2 was run with the default arguments as specified in their GitHub repository. Due to the failure of AF2 to relax several of the OOD test set entries we switch off the Amber relaxation step and consider the unrelaxed models for further evaluation. Additionally, we removed an OOD test set entry for which we were unable to obtain the AF2 prediction. We considered the best models from AF2 (based on the ipTM+pTM score) and AF3 (based on the ranking score) for comparison with Disobind. The ipTM score was used to assess the overall model confidence and the pLDDT and PAE metrics assessed the per-residue confidence. pLDDT scores higher than 70 and PAE values lower than 5 are considered as confident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Edmunds et al., 2024</xref>). An ipTM score higher than 0.8 represents a high-confidence prediction whereas an ipTM score lower than 0.6 represents a likely incorrect prediction; predictions with ipTM scores between 0.6-0.8 require further validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Evans et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">O’Reilly et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">Yin et al., 2022</xref>).

Both the pLDDT and PAE masks are applied on the CG 1 contact map obtained from AF2 and AF3 before proceeding further. To apply an ipTM cutoff, we zero the contact maps for AlphaFold predictions with an ipTM lower than the cutoff. The binary contact map was zero-padded to the maximum length (100 residues).

We categorized residues into disorder-promoting amino acids (R, P, Q, E, G, S, A, K), aromatic amino acids (F, Y, W), hydrophobic amino acids (A, V, L, I, P, M, F, W), and polar amino acids (S, T, C, N, Q, Y, D, E, K, R, H) (Uversky, 2013, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R81">2019</xref>). For LIPs, we evaluated contacts between residues in LIPs and any residue on the partner protein. For all other residue types, we evaluated contacts between residues of the same type. To assess the predictions on specific residue types, we applied a binary mask on the predictions and the target to ignore interface residues (contacts) not involving the relevant residues (residue pairs).

For MORFchibi and DeepDISOBind, predictions were obtained using their respective webservers, using defaults. DeepDISOBind provides binary interface predictions. AIUPred predictions are converted to binary interfaces using a 0.5 threshold as specified in the paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Erdős et al., 2025</xref>). For MORFchibi, we use a 0.77 threshold for interface residues as recommended; interface residue regions shorter than four residues are eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Malhis &amp; Gsponer, 2025</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="S54"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p id="P103">Not applicable</p></sec><sec id="S55"><title>Additional resources</title><p id="P104">Not applicable</p></sec></sec><sec id="SM1" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Supplement 1</label><caption><p id="P105">Table S1: Hyperparams.xlsx – Excel file containing hyperparameters for model training.</p></caption><media id="d67e3026" orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="media-1.docx" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S56"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p id="P106">We thank ISB Lab members Shreyas Arvindekar, Muskaan Jindal, Omkar Golatkar, and Mubashira KP for their useful comments on the manuscript.

For each PDB chain, missing residues in the structures are excluded, resulting in sequence fragments. Further, we restrict the maximum length of a sequence fragment to 100 residues. We use annotations from DisProt, IDEAL, and MobiDB to classify a sequence fragment as an IDR. Next, we obtain inter-chain binary complexes comprising at least one IDR fragment. Contact maps are obtained for all binary complexes which are subsequently grouped based on the UniProt accessions of the sequence fragment pair. The contact maps of all binary complexes in a group are merged, creating merged contact maps. A sequence fragment pair and its corresponding merged contact map comprise a merged binary complex. The merged binary complexes are redundancy reduced at a 20% sequence identity cutoff to create an out-of-distribution (OOD) test set. The remaining complexes comprise the Disobind training set which is split into train, dev, and in-distribution (ID) test sets.</p></caption><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="nihpp-2024.12.19.629373v6-f0001.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2:</label><caption><title>Disobind architecture.</title><p id="P116">The inputs to Disobind are the sequence embeddings for the sequence pair obtained using a pLM. The sequence embeddings are projected to a lower dimension using a projection block. Next, in the interaction block, the projected embeddings are used to compute the outer product and outer difference, which is subsequently concatenated along the feature dimension, resulting in an interaction tensor. For contact map prediction, this interaction tensor is processed by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). For interface residue prediction, the interaction tensor is reduced by computing row-wise and column-wise averages and further processed by an MLP. Next, an output block provides element-wise sigmoid scores, with a score greater than 0.5 representing a contact or interface residue.
