Multiple types of interacting IDRs were identified including molecular recognition fragments (MoRFs), short linear sequence motifs (SLiMs), and protein-, nucleic acids- and lipid-binding regions. Prediction of binding IDRs in protein sequences is gaining momentum in recent years. We survey 38 predictors of binding IDRs that target interactions with a diverse set of partners, such as peptides, proteins, RNA, DNA and lipids. We offer a historical perspective and highlight key events that fueled efforts to develop these methods. These tools rely on a diverse range of predictive architectures that include scoring functions, regular expressions, traditional and deep machine learning and meta-models. Recent efforts focus on the development of deep neural network-based architectures and extending coverage to RNA, DNA and lipid-binding IDRs. We analyze availability of these methods and show that providing implementations and webservers results in much higher rates of citations/use. We also make several recommendations to take advantage of modern deep network architectures, develop tools that bundle predictions of multiple and different types of binding IDRs, and work on algorithms that model structures of the resulting complexes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="ab0015"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p><fig id="fig0010" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><alt-text id="at0015">ga1</alt-text><graphic orientation="portrait" position="float" xlink:href="ga1.jpg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/></fig></p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Intrinsic disorder</kwd><kwd>Disordered binding regions</kwd><kwd>Short linear motifs</kwd><kwd>Molecular recognition features</kwd><kwd>Protein-protein interactions</kwd><kwd>Protein-nucleic acids interactions</kwd><kwd>Protein-lipid interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="keys0010"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>IDP, intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>IDR, intrinsically disordered region</kwd><kwd>SLiM, short linear sequence motif</kwd><kwd>MoRF, molecular recognition fragment</kwd><kwd>CAID, Critical Assessment of Intrinsic Disorder</kwd><kwd>CASP, Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction</kwd><kwd>DL, deep learning</kwd><kwd>ML, machine learning</kwd><kwd>NN, neural network</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are segments in a protein sequence that lack stable structure under physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) include one or more IDRs, and they could be fully disordered when an IDR covers the entire chain.

Being involved in key regulatory pathways, mis-regulation of IDPs and IDRs was shown to be associated with several human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>. Many of functions of IDPs involve interactions with a broad spectrum of partner molecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, metals, ions, carbohydrates and small-molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>. In that context, conformational plasticity of IDRs provides them with certain advantages compared to structured regions, such as ability of a single IDR to interact with multiple different partners, leading to an enrichment of IDPs among the hub proteins in the protein interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>. Multiple types of interacting IDRs were categorized and characterized in the literature. Two of these types concern relative short sequences regions, molecular recognition fragments (MoRFs) and short linear sequence motifs (SLiMs). MoRFs are short IDRs that undergo disorder-to-order transition when interacting with proteins and peptides, i.e., they “morph” from disorder to order upon binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>. Their length range varies across studies, with some works limiting their length to between 10 and 70 residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, and other studies considering much shorter, 5–25 residues long, regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>. MoRFs are subdivided into multiple classes including α-MoRFs, β-MoRFs, γ-MoRFs and complex-MoRFs, based on the type of the secondary structure that they fold into upon binding, i.e., α -helix, β-sheet, irregular structures, and mixed secondary structures, respectively. SLiMs are relatively short sequence motifs represented by regular expressions that are found across multiple proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>. Majority of SLiMs are between 3 and 15 residues in length and many of them are disordered. They are associated with a variety of molecular interactions, primarily being involved in interactions with proteins and nucleic-acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">[43]</xref>. Recent update of the ELM resource, a repository of eukaryotic linear motifs, reports over 3500 SLiMs that were curated from literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">[40]</xref>. Moreover, human proteome was predicted to contain over 1 million binding motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">[44]</xref>. Another type of binding IDR called protean segments is defined by the IDEAL database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">[45]</xref>. These are short segments that are disordered in an unbound form and undergo folding upon binding with a partner molecule. The protean segments overlap with MoRFs and SLiMs but they are not limited in length like MoRFs, and do not have to be defined by regular expressions like SLiMs. The above three classes of binding IDRs are defined by their sequence features (length and motifs), modes of interactions with the partner molecule (coupled binding and folding), and binding to specific types of partners (proteins, peptides and nucleic acids). However, some interacting IDRs can be long, may not involve motifs, and may bind a variety of other molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>. For instance, IDRs longer than 30 residues that bind proteins and peptides were classified as protein-binding IDRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">[47]</xref>.</p><p id="p0010">While a huge number of binding IDRs occur in nature, only a relative handful of them has been annotated by biochemical experiments. More specifically, a few hundred IDRs with binding information are available in the DisProt database, the largest repository of functionally annotated IDRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">[30]</xref>. Computational methods can help with closing this annotation gap. The limited collection of annotated binding IDRs can be used to develop and evaluate computational predictors, which then can be utilized to predict these regions for the millions of protein sequences that remain unannotated. This approach relies on the fact that the disordered nature of IDRs is intrinsic (i.e., encoded) in their underlying sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>, making them predictable from the sequence. This has motivated development of numerous methods that accurately predict IDRs from the protein sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">61</xref>, with over 100 methods that were developed to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">[62]</xref>. Recent research has shifted from building disorder predictors to developing methods that predict binding IDRs. Similar to IDRs, recent study shows that binding IDRs also have compositional bias in their sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">[48]</xref>, suggesting that they can be predicted directly from the sequence. Significance of these predictors is reflected by the inclusion of the assessment of the binding IDRs predictions in the recently completed community-organized Critical Assessment of Intrinsic disorder (CAID) experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">[63]</xref>. The CAID experiment evaluated 11 predictors of disordered binding regions; we discuss further details later.</p><p id="p0015">Predictors of intrinsic disorder have been comprehensively surveyed and analyzed in a large number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">76</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">77</xref>. They were evaluated in a several comparative assessments, most notably as part of the community-driven efforts including the Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">78</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">79</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">81</xref> and more recently the CAID experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">[63]</xref>. Disorder prediction was part of CASP between CASP5 in 2002 that evaluated six methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">[81]</xref> and CASP10 in 2012 which assessed 28 predictors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">[78]</xref>, compared to CAID that was performed in 2018 and compared 32 disorder predictors. In contrast, only a few reviews focus on prediction of binding IDRs while over three dozen of these methods were developed. A survey that covered 12 predictors of binding IDRs that were discussed together with over 30 disorder predictors was published in 2017 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">[82]</xref>. Two articles were published in 2019 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">83</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">84</xref>. The first overviews 20 predictors of binding IDRs that target MoRFs, SLiMs, and other protein-binding IDRs, while omitting methods that target other types of interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">[83]</xref>. The second is a book chapter that describes 22 predictors of MoRFs, SLiMs, protein and nucleic acid binding regions, largely overlapping in scope with the other study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">[84]</xref>. We note that prediction of disordered binding region is gaining momentum in recent years, with 13 methods published since 2019. These factors motivate this systematic survey of predictors of binding IDRs. We provide a historical perspective, comprehensively enumerate current tools, categorize them based on architectures and their predictive targets, details predictive architectures for several tools that secured best results in the CAID experiment, highlight a few interesting observations concerning availability and impact of these tools, and offer several recommendations. Moreover, we fill the gap created after the surveys from 2019 and cover 38 methods that target a diverse set of ligands including peptides, proteins, RNA, DNA and lipids.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><label>2</label><title>Historical overview</title><p id="p0020">We perform an exhaustive literature search to identify a comprehensive collection of predictors of binding IDRs.

The initial focus was primarily confined to the prediction of MoRFs and SLiMs, with 10 out of the 11 methods that were published before 2015 targeting these two types of binding IDRs. The very first method is α-MoRFpred that was developed by Keith Dunker’s group in 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">[39]</xref>. It predicts α-helix-forming MoRFs by relying on the PONDR VL-XT-generated disorder predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">[58]</xref>. The main challenge at this point was lack of annotated MoRF regions, which had to be manually compiled from the data available in Protein Data Bank (PDB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">125</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">126</xref>. The α-MoRFpred was developed using a small dataset of 14 MoRFs from 12 proteins, which were unlikely to represent a broader population of MoRF regions. An improved version of this algorithm, α-MoRFpred-II, was published two years later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">[85]</xref>. This predictor utilized a larger training dataset (102 MoRF regions from 99 proteins) and a machine learning algorithm, a shallow feed-forward neural network. However, implementation of the resulting predictor was not released, limiting its potential applications. The year 2012 marks the release of MoRFpred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">87</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">88</xref>, the first predictor that tackles prediction of generic MoRFs, irrespective of their type (as compared to α-MoRFs). This method has a more advanced design compared to the earlier tools. It uses a comprehensive sequence-derived input, which includes evolutionary profile and putative disorder, solvent accessibility and B-factors, that is processed by a support vector machine model. The model was trained on a large dataset of over 400 proteins with MoRF regions and the resulting predictor was released as a publicly accessible webserver, which is operational to this date.<fig id="fig0005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Timeline of the development of predictors of binding IDRs.

SLiMFinder, the first predictor of SLiMs, was published by Denis Shields’s lab in 2007 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">[109<bold>]</bold></xref>. This method utilizes the SLiMBuild algorithm that constructs motifs, ranks them by their probability, and estimates their statistical significance. SLiMFinder offers options to restricts motif finding to specific regions of the protein sequence, such as IDRs that it predicts with the IUPred method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">[59]</xref>, and is available in the form of a convenient webserver. Several other methods that produce SLiMs were developed subsequently, with majority of them including SLiMSearch 1.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">[110]</xref>, SLiMSearch 2.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">[111<bold>]</bold></xref>, SLiMPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">[112<bold>]</bold></xref>, SLiMPrints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">[113<bold>]</bold></xref>, PepBindPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">[114<bold>]</bold></xref> and SLiMSearch 4.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">[117<bold>]</bold></xref> developed by the labs of Denis Shields and Norman Davey.</p><p id="p0035">With growing interest in prediction of binding IDRs, the focus has gradually shifted towards prediction of IDRs that interact with specific ligands, such as proteins, RNA, DNA, and lipids. ANCHOR, which was published by Zsuzsanna Dosztanyi’s lab in 2009, is the first method that predicts protein-binding IDRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">106</xref>. ANCHOR is based on a scoring function that was derived by comparing disordered binding residues between their bound and unbound states. The prediction process is very fast and this method is available as a source code and a webserver. These factors undoubtedly contribute to high levels of popularity of this tool. DisoRDPbind, which was released by Lukasz Kurgan’s lab in 2015, is the first method that predicts nucleic acid binding IDRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">127</xref>. This tool relies on three relatively simple logistic regressions that are used to predict protein-binding, RNA-binding, and DNA-binding IDRs. The only other tools that target prediction of the nucleic acid-binding IDRs are flDPnn and DeepDISOBind that were released very recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">120</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">121</xref>. They improve over the DisoRDPbind’s model by utilizing more sophisticated deep neural networks. The newest addition to the toolbox of predictors of binding IDRs are the two tools that predict lipid-binding IDRs, DisoLipPred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">[122<bold>]</bold></xref> and MemDis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">[123<bold>]</bold></xref>, which were released in 2021. Interestingly, they complement each other since MemDis focuses on IDRs in trans-membrane proteins while DisoLipPred predicts lipid-binding IDRs that specifically exclude trans-membrane regions. Lastly, we note that there are no predictors for the protean regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Major events</title><p id="p0040">The timeline in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig0005">Fig. 1</xref> can be divided into two distinct periods, a first-generation period before 2015 and a second-generation period that started in 2015. The first-generation period is characterized by a relatively slower pace of the development efforts, with on average 1.1 new methods published per year, and focus on a small subset of the binding IDR types, such as MoRFs and SLiMs. The efforts intensified in the second-generation period, with on average 3.4 methods published per year and a broader coverage of binding IDR types, which include MoRFs, SLiMs, protein-binding, nucleic acid-binding, and lipid-binding IDRs. This increase results from an improved availability of ground-truth annotations of binding IDRs. The early methods, such as α-MoRFpred, α-MoRFpred-II, MoRFpred, and MoRF<sub>CHiBi</sub>, primarily relied on parsing data from PDB, which is rather difficult since it requires processing atomic-level data, aggregation at residue level and comparing across multiple structures given that PDB files are redundant and often cover fragments of protein sequences. Moreover, these data are also limited since PDB centers on providing access to structured proteins and regions. The first database of disordered proteins, DisProt, was established in 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">128</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">129</xref>. It started with a few hundred IDPs that were annotated based on published experimental data. It took several years before the annotations of binding were added and a sufficiently large number of these annotations was collected. By early 2010 s the amount of the accumulated binding IDRs was sufficient to develop and test predictive tools, and the second-generation tools, such as DisoRDPbind, flDPnn, DeepDISObind, DisoLipPred, and MemDis, rely on DisProt to source training and test datasets. These annotations are easier to collect compared to PDB data since they are reported at the residue level and mapped into full protein sequences. Moreover, they are more diverse, allowing to collect data to develop methods for more types of binding IDRs.</p><p id="p0045">Besides the development and growth of DisProt, the other significant event that stimulates efforts to develop predictors of binding IDRs is the CAID experiment, which was held in 2018 and included evaluation of the these predictors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">[63]</xref>. CAID is the first community-driven evaluation of accuracy of predictions of binding IDRs, which suggests growing interest in this area.

We refrain from reporting predictive performance of individual methods based on their respective publications since these results should not be directly compared due to differences in the datasets, metrics and test procedures used. We also note several drawbacks of CAID. It performs evaluation of binding predictions in a ligand agnostic way, i.e., different types of binding IDRs were clumped together. We note that the five above-baseline methods target prediction of protein-binding IDRs, benefitting from the fact that 72% of the binding annotations in the CAID dataset are protein-binding. Overall, this challenge shows substantial potential for future improvements. Interestingly, some of these limitations are being addressed in the currently pending CAID2 experiment (https://idpcentral.org/caid). CAID2 expands the assessment of predictions of binding IDRs by introducing assessment of ligand-specific prediction that cover protein-binding and nucleic-acid binding. This will likely result in a further growth in the efforts to generate more diverse and more accurate methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0025"><label>3</label><title>Predictors of disordered binding regions</title><p id="p0050"><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl0005">Table 1</xref> covers several important aspects of the 38 predictors of binding IDRs, such as their predictive architectures, modes of availability, and popularity quantified with citations.

We note that methods developed since 2020 exclusively utilize the DL models. Part of the reason why these models could be developed is that a sufficient amount of training data has become available in recent years, driven mostly by the substantial growth of the DisProt database. When a sufficient amount of training data became available and given the breakthroughs in the designs of deep network architectures in the past decade and the resulting high-levels of their predictive performance, unsurprisingly, researchers in this field have shifted to adopt DL algorithms instead of traditional ML. This is likely also motivated by the recent influx and success of DL-based predictors of intrinsic disorder. Notably, the top-performing disorder predictors in CAID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">[134<bold>]</bold></xref> include flDPnn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">[51]</xref>, SPOT-Disorder2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">[52]</xref>, rawMSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">[53]</xref> and AUCpred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">[54]</xref>, all of which rely on the DL models.

ANCHOR2 uses a computationally efficient linear function to combine the interaction energy estimation from ANCHOR with two new terms that estimate energy for interaction with binding surface of globular proteins and presence of a disordered sequence. This results in a more accurate model that still retains the small computational footprint of ANCHOR.</p><p id="p0120">DisoRDPbind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">[118<bold>]</bold></xref> is a shallow ML method that utilizes three logistic regression models to predict RNA-binding, DNA-binding and protein-binding propensities, one regression for each ligand type.

There are two types of implementations: webserver (WS) and source code (SC). WS is available online via a web browser or programmable interface, typically does not require installation of any software, and performs all computations on the server side. While webservers are usually accessed via webpages, in a few cases (e.g., SLiMPred, SLiMPrints and QSLiMFinder) the access is based on the representational state transfer (REST) interface. SC have to be downloaded, installed/compiled and run on user’s hardware. While WSs are easier to use, they are typically limited to prediction of a single or a few proteins at the time and could be difficult to embed into other bioinformatics platforms if they lack programmable interface. On the other hand, SC usually can be setup to perform predictions on a larger scale and is easier to incorporate into other bioinformatics software, but it can be challenging to install and requires hardware to run. We collect the location of these WS and SC resources as per information given in the respective publications and check their availability. We find 27 methods that have working WS and/or SC implementations. Among them 13 methods are available solely as WS, 3 as SC and 11 as both WS and SC. There are 4 methods which were once functional but as of July 2022 did not work, and 7 methods that were never implemented for public use. The corresponding 71% rate of availability (27 out of 38 methods) is relatively high, higher than the 65% availability rate for disorder predictors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">[62]</xref>, and much higher than the approximately 40% rate for other related predictors of protein-binding and nucleic acid binding residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">146</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">147</xref>.</p><p id="p0145">We analyze impact/use of these methods, which we quantify in using citations collected from Google Scholar as of July 2022 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl0005">Table 1</xref>). We provide total number of citations as well as an annual count, where the latter is a better metric to compare impact/use of different methods. The predictors published from 2020 onwards are too new to reliably measure their citation data, hence, we exclude them from the below analysis. We find that methods which offer WS and/or SC implementation are cited much more often (median annual citations = 12), compared to methods which were never made available (median annual citations = 3). Moreover, among the methods which are currently functional, the tools that provide both WS and SC are cited more (median annual citations = 16) compared to the methods that provide only WS (median annual citations = 12) and only SC (median annual citations = 4). The higher popularity of predictors implemented as WSs is because they are arguably more convenient for majority of users who have limited computational resources and are less computer savvy to be able to install and run software locally. Methods with no implementations suffer low citations, revealing that availability directly influences the level of use and impact. These observations suggest that future methods should be made available as both WS and SC to maximize impact. Moreover, we find that among the methods which have/had WS and/or SC implementations, the ones which are currently non-functional receive median annual citations of 4, which is 4 times lower than the functional methods. This means that it is vitally important to maintain availability after methods are released.</p><p id="p0150">We briefly discuss impact/use of individual tools. Predictor of protein-binding IDRs, ANCHOR2, is the most highly cited method, both in terms of annual citations (189) and total citations (754). We note that ANCHOR2′s publication also introduces a popular disorder predictor, IUPred2, which likely inflates the above number; this is also why we use median annual citations to compare groups of tools. There are 9 predictors that were cited over 100 times and 4 of them were cited over 500 times. These observations should be considered with a pinch of salt, since these tools were published in 2016 or earlier and had more time to accumulate citations when compared to newer methods. However, this reveals a significant amount of interest in using these methods.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0055"><label>4</label><title>Summary and outlook</title><p id="p0155">IDRs interact with many different molecular partners including proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, small molecules, carbohydrates, and metals. The knowledge of these interactions is rather limited, which motivates development of computations tools that predicts them from the readily available protein sequences. This comprehensive survey of sequence-based predictors of binding IDRs covers a wide range of interacting partners. We identify and summarize a large collection of 38 predictors that consider 5 different types of interacting IDRs. The MoRF predictors are the largest category with 21 methods, followed by 9 SLiM predictors, 3 predictors of protein-binding IDRs, 3 methods that predict protein/DNA/RNA binding IDRs and 2 predictors of lipid-binding IDRs. We find that these methods rely on a diverse range of predictive architectures that include scoring functions, regular expressions, machine learning models and meta-predictors, where about three-quarters of them utilize machine learning algorithms. We observe a couple of recent trends to develop deep network-based models and to extend coverage to new types of interacting IDRs, such as RNA, DNA and lipid binding regions. We also note a high rate of availability of these methods, with over 70% that are provided to the end users as either webservers and/or standalone code. Furthermore, we analyze relation between availability and impact/use of these methods. We find that methods which are more broadly available, as both webserver and source code, are substantially more cited/used when compared to those that are available in either format, while methods that do not offer a publicly available implementation suffer low use/citations. Moreover, we also find that the availability should be maintained since tools that were originally made available and are currently not functional observe a large drop in the use/citations. The latter observations strongly suggest that future predictors should be made available in both formats upon publication and should be maintained after publication.</p><p id="p0160">While IDPs interact with a broad range of molecular partners, we show that the current predictors are largely focused on two types of binding IDRs, MoRFs and SLiMs. A particularly acute situation concerns prediction of nucleic acid and lipid-binding IDRs, where only a handful of methods are available. The prediction of small molecules-, carbohydrates-, and metal-binding IDRs is not feasible at the moment, given a very small amount of ground truth data. The need to develop new predictors of DNA and RNA binding regions is further motivated by the inclusion of this prediction category in the pending CAID2 experiment. Consequently, one of the key future directions would be to diversify the development efforts to more uniformly cover different types of binding IDRs.</p><p id="p0165">Results of the recently completed CAID assessment show that predictors of binding IDRs offer modest levels of predictive performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">[63]</xref>, suggesting that there is a large room for improvement. We observe that none of the methods that participated in this evaluation use deep learning models. The recent influx of the deep learning-based predictors of binding IDRs will likely result in improved predictive quality. This claim stems from a recent study that empirically demonstrates that deep learning-based predictors of intrinsic disorder significantly outperform other types of models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">[64]</xref>. The drive to use deep learning models is also motivated by the growing and successful use of these models in related areas of bioinformatics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">[148<bold>]</bold></xref>, such as prediction of protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">149</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">150</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">151</xref> and protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib152">152</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">153</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">154</xref>. We envision that majority of future predictors of binding IDRs will likely rely on deep neural networks. We encourage the developers to consider modern network topologies, such as the recently developed transformers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">[155<bold>]</bold></xref>, that were used to very accurately predict protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">[156<bold>]</bold></xref>.</p><p id="p0170">Some IDPs include IDRs that interact with different types of ligands and yet most of the current methods cover a single ligand type. Consequently, users are forced to use multiple methods and convert between different output formats to obtain a complete prediction. These difficulties could be alleviated with solutions that bundle multiple predictors, however, the only such solution to date is the DEPICTER webserver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib157">[157<bold>]</bold></xref>. Moreover, there are only a handful of methods that predict IDRs that bind to multiple ligand types, such as DisoRDPbind, flDPnn and DeepDISObind, that target protein, RNA and DNA-binding IDRs. Consequently, we advocate for the development of new tools that address predictions of multiple and many different types of binding IDRs. Furthermore, some IDRs can bind multiple partner types, which corresponds to multi-label (multi-output) learning. Prediction of such multifunctional IDRs is possible with the DMRpred method, although this tool does not provide types of binding partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">[158<bold>]</bold></xref>. Thus, new tools that would cast this prediction as multi-labels problem should be developed. We note that multi-labels predictors are widely used in related areas, such as prediction of subcellular localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">159</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">160</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">161</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">162</xref>, nucleic acid binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">[163<bold>]</bold></xref>, enzymatic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">[164<bold>]</bold></xref>, and ion channel types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib165">[165<bold>]</bold></xref>.</p><p id="p0175">Prediction of the binding IDRs in protein sequences should be followed by modelling structures of the corresponding complexes (i.e., IDRs fold upon binding). While computational protein docking has been extensively pursued over the past several years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">[166<bold>]</bold></xref>, studies that investigate docking with IDPs are lagging behind since IDPs are difficult to model. Daisuke Kihara’s lab developed a pioneering approach for IDP-protein docking, IDP-LZerD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">167</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">168</xref>. This method produces a docking model from the 3D structure of the receptor and the sequence of interacting IDP. Docking an IDP is conceptually similar to protein-small peptide docking, but technically more challenging because conformation of the IDP on the receptor’s surface has to be predicted. In IDP-LZerD, this is done by docking and stitching short protein fragments taken from the binding IDR. Moreover, a recent benchmark study that evaluates three methods capable of docking with IDPs, IDP-LZerD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">167</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">168</xref>, CABS-Dock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">[169<bold>]</bold></xref> and AlphaFold-Multimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib170">[170<bold>]</bold></xref>, shows that they accurately identify location of the binding site but struggle with atomic-levels details of the structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">[171<bold>]</bold></xref>, suggesting that further research is needed.</p><p id="p0180">Lastly, databases like D<sup>2</sup>P<sup>2</sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib172">[172<bold>]</bold></xref>, MobiDB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">173</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">174</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">175</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">176</xref> and DescribePROT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">[177<bold>]</bold></xref> provide convenient access to pre-computed predictions of disorder for millions of proteins. However, they typically contain a limited number of binding IDR predictions, with DescribePROT covering the most diverse range that includes putative protein, RNA and DNA-binding IDRs. This coverage should be extended in the future as more methods that cover a broader range of binding IDRs will be developed. In turn, this effort motivates the development of runtime-efficient predictors that can be used to perform predictions on such large scale. Examples of current fast tools include ANCHOR2, DisoRDPbind and fMoRFpred, that were shown to produce predictions in about 1 second per protein in the CAID experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">[63]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0060"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0185">LK was funded in part by the <funding-source id="gs1"><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="doi">10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source> (DBI2146027 and IIS2125218) and the <funding-source id="gs2">Robert J.
