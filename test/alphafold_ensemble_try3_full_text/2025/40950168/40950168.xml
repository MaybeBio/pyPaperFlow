Targets included systems with experimental structures determined in two or three states, evaluated by direct comparison to experimental coordinates, as well as domain–linker–domain (D–L–D) targets assessed against statistical models from NMR and SAXS data. This paper focuses on the former class of multi-state targets. Ten ensembles were released as community challenges, including ligand-induced conformational changes, protein–DNA complexes, a trimeric protein, a stem-loop RNA, and multiple oligomeric states of a single RNA. For five targets, some groups produced reasonably accurate models of both reference states (best TM-score &gt;0.75). However, with the exception of one protein–ligand complex (T1214), where an apo structure was available as a template, predictors generally failed to capture key structural details distinguishing the states. Overall, accuracy was significantly lower than for single-state targets in other CASP experiments. The most successful approaches generated multiple AlphaFold2 models using enhanced multiple sequence alignments and sampling protocols, followed by model quality based selection. While the AlphaFold3 server performed well on several targets, individual groups outperformed it in specific cases. By contrast, predictions for one protein–DNA complex, three RNA targets, and multiple oligomeric RNA states consistently fell short (TM-score &lt;0.75). These results highlight both progress and persistent challenges in multi-state prediction. Despite recent advances, accurate modeling of conformational ensembles, particularly RNA and large multimeric assemblies, remains a critical frontier for structural biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CASP</kwd><kwd>multi-state modeling prediction</kwd><kwd>protein structure prediction</kwd><kwd>nucleic acids</kwd><kwd>deep learning</kwd><kwd>AlphaFold2</kwd><kwd>conformational dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P5">Biomolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids, are not static objects, but rather exist as conformational distributions in dynamic equilibrium. These dynamics often underpin their functions. While recent advances in structure prediction have demonstrated outstanding success in modeling dominant conformational states of proteins, RNAs, DNAs, and their complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], there have been few critical assessments of modeling alternative or multiple conformational states.</p><p id="P6">The Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) provides a platform for “blind” assessment of protein structure models, in which the experimental reference structure is not available to the predictor groups. To address the important challenge of modeling multiple conformational states, the 2022 CASP15 community experiment included, for the first time, computing multiple conformations for protein and RNA structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>]. The results of this first CASP ensembles experiment were mixed, with full or partial success in reproducing both conformational states for four of nine targets. Across these successfully-modeled “ensemble” targets, enhanced sampling using variations of AlphaFold2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>] was the most effective approach.</p><p id="P7">The CASP16 Ensemble Prediction experiment included two types of targets: those assessed in the traditional way by comparing predicted models directly to experimentally determined coordinates, and domain–linker–domain (D–L–D) targets in which submitted model sets were evaluated against statistical models derived from experimental NMR and SAXS data. The first type is the focus of this paper, while the second is discussed in another paper in this special issue of PROTEINS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The CASP16 ensembles experiment was also guided by discussions in the on-line CASP Special Interest Group on Modeling Conformational Ensembles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>].</p><p id="P8">In the CASP experiment, we define "<italic toggle="yes">ensembles</italic>" as collections of two or more structural conformations adopted by the same macromolecular sequence, or sometimes by alternative conformations stabilized through ligand binding or small sequence variations. These ensembles range in complexity from discrete two-state systems, such as open/closed lids regulating access to enzyme active sites, to broad distributions of conformations typical of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). We define "<italic toggle="yes">conformational states</italic>" as distinct molecular conformations that have been, or could in principle be, distinguished by experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. This definition is useful in practice because it postulates predicted states to be experimentally testable, even if they have not yet been observed. Importantly, it also encompasses alternative conformational states that may be populated under certain conditions but have not yet been distinguished experimentally. Such states still meet our definition, provided they are in principle experimentally resolvable.</p><p id="P9">A total of 12 targets were identified from experimental submissions for the CASP16 ensemble assessment, representing a diverse set of biomolecular systems including membrane proteins, protein monomers, protein-DNA complexes, RNA molecules, and protein oligomers. Ten of these targets (excluding the domain-linker-domain system mentioned above) are assessed in this study; some were single-chain substructures of other larger multi-chain targets. For each target, predictors were told the number of states in the reference ensemble. For five targets, some predictors generated models that are reasonably accurate for both states (best model TM score &gt; 0.75). For the other five, all predictors failed to achieve accurate models (TM &lt; 0.75) of one or more states. These outcomes demonstrate both the potential of current methods and the substantial challenges that remain in accurate multi-state conformational modeling</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><p id="P10">The CASP Ensemble Prediction experiment assessed the accuracy of collections of alternative conformational states of biomolecules for several types of ensembles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) including: (i) hinges, (ii) lids / cryptic ligand binding sites, (iii) conformational rearrangements, (iv) intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of interdomain linkers, and (v) variations in oligomeric state (or quaternary structure). In CASP16, "blind" targets, not accessible to predictors, corresponding to each of these classes were available from experimental NMR, X-ray crystallography, and/or cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) studies. Other types of ensembles indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, including fold switching (FS) and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), were not available in the CASP16 target set.</p><p id="P11">Each of these classes of ensembles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) arises from conformational equilibria that are determined by thermodynamics. The simplest systems exhibit detectable alternative states populated according to Boltzmann distributions governed by temperature and/or pressure. These include both significantly populated multiple conformational states that can be detected simultaneously in the same sample [for example as observed for dengue virus protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]], to very lowly populated states (sometimes referred to as “invisible states”), which can be detected by specific NMR spectroscopy experiments such as relaxation dispersion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>] or chemical exchange by saturation transfer (CEST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Alternative conformational state distributions may also be modulated by binding to partners, including small ligands or other biomolecules. They may also arise (or shift in population) due to changes in the pH (affecting the ionization states of some residues), point mutations, sequence extensions or truncations, or posttranslational modifications. In the CASP16 Ensembles Prediction experiment, the CASP community was asked to predict both kinds of multiple conformational ensembles; those in which multiple states are present at equilibrium in a single sample and other cases where the alternative conformation is induced to form by ligand or biomolecular partner binding. While the relative populations of states is also a critical feature of the ensemble, aside from the protein A domain-linker-domain experiment discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>] the relative conformer populations were not requested from predictors, and no significant effort was made by predictor groups to estimate them.</p><p id="P12">The 12 targets of the CASP16 Ensembles experiment, each consisting of two or more conformational states, are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. These targets are classified by <italic toggle="yes">oligomer class</italic> as defined in previous CASP experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>], number of residues (nres), experimental method used for structure determination, number of models requested from predictors, and number of participating groups. For target T1214holo predictors were asked to submit 5 models, which were assessed by finding the model best matching to the ligand-bound state. For target R1203v1/v2 predictors were asked to submit 5 models, each assessed against both reference states. In later stages of the experiment, predictors were instructed to submit 5 models for each state. For these targets, some groups submitted models for only one state, so the number of groups submitting models for both states is slightly lower than the total number submitting for the first state. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> also summarizes the total number of models submitted by all predictor groups, the <italic toggle="yes">ensemble class</italic> as defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, and a general comment about the nature of the ensemble. T-type, M-type, and R-type targets are single chain protein or homomers, heteromultimers (protein-nucleic acid), and RNA targets, respectively. Ensemble predictions for targets T1214, M1228 (and its protein substructure T1228), M1239 (and its protein substructure T1239), T1249, T1294, R1203, R1253, and R1283 are discussed in the following sections. Targets T1200 and T1300 are domain-linker-domain (D-L-D) targets, in which the domains are treated as static conformations with relative orientations and distances determined by the conformation of the interdomain linker, an IDR. An assessment of these predictions against experimental data including NMR residual dipolar coupling (RDC) obtained using internal orientation by a paramagnetic metal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>] and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>], are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>].</p><p id="P13">The overall results of ensemble prediction performance in CASP16 are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. With the exception of target T1214, for which the apo structure was available from the PDB, no prediction groups provided high-accuracy models (e.g., GDT_TS &gt; 0.75) typical of recent CASP experiments. In this study, we used different structural-similarity metrics for the different targets, as appropriate to the target class. “Successful” modeling was defined as correctly modeling the distinct overall fold topologies and/or spatial arrangements of substructures of the multiple conformational states observed experimentally with global TM scores &gt; 0.75. Many groups “successfully” modeled the two alternative conformational states of several target sets. Among these, several groups did about equally well by our assessment metrics. However, no one group was consistently top-tier across all (or even most) targets. This is largely attributable to the wide range of target types, ranging from integral membrane proteins with ligand-induced conformational changes, to multistate protein-nucleic acid complexes, to multiple conformations of a short RNA stem-loop. Accordingly, no effort was made to compare the performance of all groups across all targets.</p><p id="P14">The performance of CASP16 predictor groups on each of the ten ensemble target groups (excluding the D-L-D targets) are summarized in the following sections.

Some groups, such as AF3-server (group 304), ShanghaiTech-human (298), ShanghaiTech-Ligand (386), modeled the ligand explicitly, whereas others, including PEZYFoldings (015), falcon2 (208) and Zheng (462), reported that their predictions were generated without including the ligand.</p><p id="P18">PEZYFoldings used an AlphaFold2-Multimer-based pipeline augmented with extensive sequence searches, MSA construction, and comprehensive template selection, followed by OpenMM relaxation and a custom rescoring method. Although they did not include the ligand in their reported modeling protocol, they still captured binding-pocket conformations consistent with the holo state, suggesting that MSA-driven context alone provided sufficient information to guide the conformational shift. The available low sequence identity templates (&lt; 22%) include ligand-bound porins that may have impacted the modeling, such as FecA–citrate (PDB 1KMP) and FoxA–Fe-Qercetin (PDB 6I97), which contain similar bent β-hairpin motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Table S8</xref>).

States V1 (cis) and V2 (trans) can interconvert by such rotation, which is thought to be part of the mechanism of gene recombination by exchanging DNA strands to enable alternate DNA connectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]. Each half of the tetramer can be considered an asymmetric dimer, containing one “V-shaped” and one “compact-shaped” protomer (see target T1228 below for further discussion). While the interfaces within each half are conserved, the flat hydrophobic interface between halves allows the lower dimer to swivel relative to the upper dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2D</xref>).

In both states, the longer DNA duplexes (33- and 35-base pairs) bind to V-shaped protomers, while the shorter duplexes (24- and 25-base pairs) bind to compact-shaped protomers. These structures are interpreted as evidence for a conformational switching mechanism that reconfigures DNA connectivity like a railway switch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>].</p><p id="P20">The challenge was to model both the V1 (cis) and V2 (trans) tetrameric assemblies, capturing symmetry, protomer conformations, and the large-scale structural change. FoldSeek [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>] confirmed that no close sequence templates (&lt; 20% identity) were available in the PDB.

As the state labels assigned by predictors were arbitrary, we reassigned them by scoring each set against both reference structures using TM-scores. The highest-scoring model across all comparisons determined the initial assignment (e.g., assigning predicted set A to V1); the other predicted set was then assigned to the remaining reference (e.g., set B to V2). The sum of TM-scores from the best model in each set gave “two-state scores” that were used to rank predictor groups (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="S12">Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This procedure can be generalized to more than two reference states when multiple structures are available. TM-score was selected over GDT_TS scores because the highest GDT_TS values for both states were below 0.4, whereas TM-scores exceeded 0.75 for the best models. TM-score is more tolerant of structural variations and better reflects overall fold correctness, while GDT_TS penalizes even small domain movements or misalignments, producing uniformly low values that prohibit identification of correct models for large multi-domain proteins.</p><p id="P22">Based on TM-score analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), most groups predicted the V2-trans <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M12"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> conformational state more accurately (14 / 27), with eight capturing inter-dimer coiled coil (CC) handshakes between D4 domains, including groups Zheng (462), Vfold (481), and AF3-server (304) (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref><bold>F-G</bold>, <bold>right</bold>).

A key modeling challenge was the lack of close structural homologs: none of the available templates for domains D1–D4 had more than ~ 20% sequence identity. The best alignments were for domain D1, including smaller tetrameric DNA-bound complexes related to M1228. Additional templates, such as PDB IDs 4KIS and 6DNW, covered D2 and the first part of D3 (DNA-binding region). These resemble state V1 more closely than V2, but are not dimeric or tetrameric. By contrast, D4 templates were restricted to short alignments with coiled-coil containing proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S8</xref>). These biases likely explain why most predictors, including AF3-server (304), modeled V1 better than V2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, <bold>bottom</bold>).

Even for the highest scoring models, the functionally important inter-dimer CC contacts do not match the experimental structures. As detailed in the accompanying CASP Special Issue paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>], modeling of DNA-binding domain interactions in this active tetramer was often inaccurate and was not directly evaluated in our study. AF3-server (304) predictions were dimers, not tetramers, and are therefore not a suitable baseline for evaluating tetramer predictions. Some predicted tetramers did not match either experimental state, potentially reflecting alternative assemblies rather than the two that have been observed experimentally.

The trimeric complex consists of three identical 488-residue monomers; however, the reference coordinates and sequence provided to predictors corresponded only to the cryoEM–modeled region (residues 59–415, A3). The compact, tightly packed closed state (V1) contrasts with the open state (V2), which was induced by acidic pH together with tight binding to an unidentified metal ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>]. In the trimer, three His157 side chains, one from each protomer, coordinate this metal ion, shifting the equilibrium toward the open state and likely stabilizing it during cell entry.

These states differ primarily in the number and position of non-canonical base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>]. In the open state, the three-way junction is thought to facilitate initial high-affinity Rev binding at the unpaired base U65 in the major groove, which then promotes subsequent cooperative binding and oligomerization.</p><p id="P38">CASP16 predictors submitted five models, and each was evaluated against both the open (V1) and closed (V2) conformations observed experimentally. As with T1214, predictors were scored using the two-state <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M23"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mml:mi>Σ</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> metric, which combines global and local accuracy, with the local component focused on ROIs that differ most significantly between states. These ROIs, highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">B</xref>, correspond to loop and groove segments implicated in Rev binding. Score distributions showed a small cluster of groups that modestly outperformed the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">D</xref>, <bold>Supplementary Table S9</bold>). The top five groups, AF3-server (304), elofsson (241), isyslab-hust (235), RNAFOLDX (435) and Bhattacharya (369) had higher scores for state V1 than for V2. In more than half the cases, the same model would have ranked highest for both states if it had been allowed (data not shown), indicating that predictors struggled to distinguish between open and closed states. No submission exceeded a <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M24"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle mathvariant="normal"><mml:mi>Σ</mml:mi></mml:mstyle><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> score of 51 for V1 or 40 for V2, indicating overall poor performance. The top TM-scores for each state were 0.64 and 0.72, values that indicate the overall fold was captured but fall short of the &gt; 0.75 threshold typical of high-accuracy models and defined here as "successful". The IIb loop and exposure of unpaired U65 were consistently mispredicted, and even the top-scoring group, AF3-server, failed to reproduce the IIb loop orientation or non-canonical base pairing in either conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">F</xref>). Overall, R1203 was especially challenging, revealing limitations in current RNA prediction methods for modeling conformational transitions, three-way junctions, and non-canonical base pairs, as noted in other CASP16 RNA target evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>].</p><p id="P39">While no groups were "successful" - based on our criteria defined above - with this target, the top-performing groups were AF3-server and elofsson (241) using human-refined AF3 predictions.

RNAFOLDX (435) utilized a distinct convolutional neural network for modeling, with performance rivaling AF3-server.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Unsuccessfully modeled targets.</title><p id="P40">Despite the successful (five cases) and promising but unsuccessful (two other cases) results in predicting structures of the two alternative states observed experimentally for the 7 protein-ligand, protein-DNA, trimeric protein, and RNA targets outlined above, CASP16 predictors were unsuccessful in modeling structures of 3 additional target sets, <italic toggle="yes">viz</italic> T1294v1/v2, R1253v1/v2, and R1283v1/v2/v3. Target T1294, a homodimeric isocyanide hydratase protein, was provided with two structural states (V1 and V2), but careful visualization revealed only subtle differences between them, with minimal domain-level rearrangement. The assessors' consensus was that these structural transitions were too minor to represent meaningful alternative conformations. Consequently, this target was excluded from detailed assessment. Most predictor submissions showed near-identical models for both states, and no group successfully distinguished or justified a biologically relevant structural transition. RNA targets R1253 and R1283 were also very challenging. These were large RNA molecules (574 and 580 nucleotides respectively) provided in multiple oligomeric states monomer (A1), tetramer (A4), and octamer (A8)- requiring accurate modeling of RNA tertiary structure as well as quaternary assembly, often in the absence of homologous templates or well-characterized structural motifs. Across all groups, predictions failed to recover global fold, domain architecture, or base-pairing pattern in any of the states. The highest global GDT_TS scores for monomeric forms were below 20, and for higher-order assemblies, scores dropped below 1. Superpositions with experimental structures revealed extensive misfolding and poor modeling of key structural junctions and tertiary contacts. These outcomes reflect the current limitations of RNA modeling approaches, especially when faced with large, flexible RNAs undergoing oligomerization. No participating method succeeded in capturing the large-scale structural reorganization required for tetrameric or octameric assembly. These findings are consistent with broader trends observed in the CASP16 RNA structure assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref>], highlighting the need for more advanced tools capable of handling RNA multimerization and conformational heterogeneity. Within this context, R1253 and R1283 were among the most challenging RNA targets in this experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P41">Overall, CASP16 predictors were “successful” in modeling key structural features of both alternative conformational states for five of these ten CASP16 ensemble modeling targets. This includes target T1214, for which the structure of one state (apo) was available in the PDB, and predictors were challenged to model structural details of a second (holo) state. However, no one group dominated in these performance rankings across all targets. This is attributable to the fact that the successful targets spanned a wide range of target types, including ligand binding to an integral membrane protein (target T1214_holo), a large and complex tetrameric protein-dsDNA complex (target M1228), the corresponding subunits of protein-dsDNA complexes (targets T1228 and T1239), and a trimeric protein (T1249). Predictors were not successful in predicting the tetrameric protein-dsDNA complexes (target M1239), the observed oligomerization states of protein target T1294, the two conformations with specific base-pairing of the RNA stem loop (R1203), or the structural ensembles reported for RNA targets R1253 and R1283. In the case of the M1239 protein-DNA complex, successful modeling was challenged by long-range interactions between the longer D4 domain and dsDNA.</p><p id="P42">TM-score and GDT-TS V1 vs V2 scatter plots for several of the most-successfully modeled targets are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>. These plots illustrate the range of TM- and GDT_TS scores obtained for the most successful target pairs, excluding target T1214 for which only one state (holo) was modeled. While some predictors submitted “best” models with relatively high TM scores (as high as 0.98), for GDT-TS the scores are generally lower (&lt; 0.72). In nearly all cases, detailed analysis of these models demonstrates the significant challenges encountered by most groups in predicting key structural details, such as the coiled-coil handshake of targets M1228 and M1239, or key non-canonical base pairing interactions of target R1203.</p><p id="P43">Most of the successful methods used in these ensemble predictions leveraged AlphaFold2 and/or AlphaFold3 initial models and/or used these methods as the primary inference engines. In several cases, and particularly for the stem-loop RNA target R1203, AF3-server (304) provided top, or near-top, two-state ensemble predictions. AF3 was released just shortly before the CASP prediction season, and only a few predictors took advantage of AF3 models. Improvements relative to the baseline AF3-server were generally driven by improved methods for generating MSAs, comprehensive template selection, and final ranking of models.</p><p id="P44">Among the predictor groups, the most broadly successful with this ensemble target set were the Zhang group, which for example predicted accurate models of the T1214holo structure, key details of the coiled-coiled handshake of target M1228, and did well on several of the other ensemble targets. However, even these best-performing methods provided models with GDT-TS and DockQ scores lower than those obtained for typical CASP16 single-state targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>).</p><p id="P45">One significant challenge in predicting alternative conformational states is the tendency for ML-based modeling methods to be biased toward conformational states present in the training set, impacting their ability to model novel conformational states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref>]. For example, <italic toggle="yes">Cfold</italic>, a structure prediction network trained on a conformational split of the PDB that excludes alternative states for protein structure pairs solved in two conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>], predicted &gt; 50% of the known alternative conformations with high accuracy (TM-score &gt; 0.75), but failed on the remaining pairs, unable to correctly model the alternative state not present in its training data. Lazou et al. observed successful predictions by AF2 of both open/closed states of cryptic binding sites in only six of 16 proteins tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref>]. In studies of the SLC-class of integral membrane proteins, we have also observed a strong preference for previously reported conformations that persist despite using several enhanced sampling methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>]. While in some cases, the AI has learned enough to model alternative conformational states not included in the training data, in other cases memorization can be hard to overcome. However, while memorization can prevent modeling of alternative states using methods based on deep learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>], at least for some of the predicted two-state ensembles of CASP16, methods were able to overcome this bias.</p><p id="P46">In the course of the study, several additional important concerns were raised. First is the distinction between conformational changes that are induced by ligands, binding partners, or sequence alterations, versus multiple conformational states that coexist within the same biomolecular sample, potentially reflecting dynamic conformational equilibria. The former generally require modeling both in the presence and absence of the modulating factor, while the latter can potentially be approached as alternative states of a single system, where binding shifts the equilibrium by conformational selection. Interestingly, in the case of the ligand-induced conformational change observed for target T1214, the <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> TonB-dependent transporter PqqU bound to PQQ, some predictor groups were able to model the holo form without inclusion of the ligand. However, it may not always be possible to model the alternative conformational state without including the binding partner. Second is the challenge of assessing prediction models against experimental structures. The accuracy of any assessment is limited by the quality of the experimental model itself; in some cases it may be preferable to assess predictions directly against experimental data, such as cryoEM density maps or NMR NOESY peak lists. Third is the challenge of predicting relative conformer populations. Predictors may sometimes identify conformational states that are correct, biologically relevant, and energetically favorable, but absent or only lowly-populated under the experimental conditions used to determine the structure. Conversely, experimental models typically represent only a subset of the conformational ensemble, and conformations may be stabilized by conditions of data collection, or, in the case of X-ray crystallography, by the crystal lattice. These issues underscore the need for assessment strategies that account for conformational ensembles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>], rather than relying solely on individual experimental structures.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P47">CASP16 demonstrated the power and limitations of AlphaFold2/3 in modeling alternative conformational states, and the key conclusion that successful prediction of alternative conformations often depends on the availability of suitable templates and informative MSAs which were essential for modeling of fold rearrangements or domain repositioning in some targets. However, overall accuracy of these ensemble targets was lower than typically observed for single-state targets, and performance varied widely depending on target complexity. Multi-conformational RNA molecules proved especially challenging, with no cases successfully predicted. Importantly, relative state populations were generally not requested or attempted, and remain unassessed. These results highlight that, despite recent advances in AI-based structure prediction and the significant interest by the structural biology community in predicting multiple conformational states and conformational ensembles of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes, accurate modeling of multiple conformational states—particularly for RNA and large multimeric assemblies—remains a fundamental challenge and an important focus for future CASP experiments.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S13"><title>Structure comparison and alignment.</title><p id="P48">Most structure quality statistics were computed by infrastructure developed and maintained by the CASP Prediction Center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref>].

Scores from multiple global and local metrics were normalized to a 0 – 100 scale. For global accuracy, we applied several complementary measures. TM-score was used to evaluate overall topological similarity, while GDT_TS was used to capture both global and local structural agreement with the experimental structures. Global LDDT provided a superposition-free measure of distance preservation across all atom pairs. In addition, the global RMSD was included to capture the magnitude of atomic displacements, particularly useful for large rigid-body movements.</p><p id="P50">To complement global assessments, we also evaluated local structural accuracy using per-residue measures. These included “local” residue-level LDDT and a “local GDT_TS” approximation based on Cα–Cα deviations reported as LGA Dev values. LGA Dev, derived from the Local–Global Alignment algorithm, quantifies per-residue distance deviations from the reference and serves as a local analog to GDT_TS. To place both global and local measures on a comparable scale, we applied sigmoid-weighted scoring functions that convert raw RMSD and LGA Dev values into intuitive scores ranging from 0 to 100.

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the evaluation proceeded as follows:</p><sec id="S17"><label>1.</label><title>Score models against both reference structures</title><p id="P61">Let <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M49"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">{</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>…</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M50"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">{</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>…</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> be the two sets of predicted models.</p><p id="P62">Each model <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M51"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">{</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="monospace">A</mml:mi><mml:mo>∪</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="monospace">B</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is scored against both reference structures v1 and v2 using a chosen structural metric, <inline-formula><mml:math display="inline" id="M52"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">V</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>:</p><list id="L4" list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="P63">
